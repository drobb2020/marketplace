        Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
        be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
        Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is
        electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use
        of the Website and Services.
