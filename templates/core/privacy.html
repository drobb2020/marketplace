        website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and
        services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting,
        using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal
        Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding
        our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update

        This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or
        “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If
        you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other
        legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such
        entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or
        “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or
        if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not
        accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and
        Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you
        acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the
        terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
        companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do
        not employ or manage.

      <h2 class="text-2xl">Collection of personal information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who
        you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you
        as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
        some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to provide
        certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
        address).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
        you create an account, publish content, or fill any forms on the
        Website. When required, this information may include the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>
          Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)
        </li>
        <li>Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
        then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on
        the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory
        are welcome to contact us.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Privacy of children</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under
        the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any
        Personal Information through the Website and Services. If you have
        reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal
        Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us to
        request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our
        Services.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
        Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
        children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and
        Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and
        legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
        precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give
        out Personal Information when online without their permission.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR
        when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data
        processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data
        controller and we would be the data processor.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving
        Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when
        we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
        ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such
        instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes
        and means of the processing of Personal Information and we comply with
        data controllers’ obligations set forth in the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit
        Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do not own,
        control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and
        such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your
        instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information
        acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a
        legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
        Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
        may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services.
        Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following
        purposes:

      <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
        <li>Improve user experience</li>
        <li>Post customer testimonials</li>
        <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
        the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one
        of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
        more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
        processing of Personal Information is subject to European data
        protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
        performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
        obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a
        legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to
        a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
        official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the
        purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon which
        we collect and process your Personal Information:
      </p>
      <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>User’s consent</li>
        <li>Our own legitimate interests</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
        information until you object to such processing by opting out, without
        having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any
        case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies
        to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
        Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
        necessary to enter into a contract.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Managing information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.
        The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and
        Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may
        maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for
        the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates
        and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to
        delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you
        can do so on the settings page of your account on the Website.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Disclosure of information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
        transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your
        information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service
        providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in
        the operation of the Website and Services available to you and whose
        privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our
        policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any
        personally identifiable information with third parties and will not
        share any information with unaffiliated third parties.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information
        except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with
        legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they
        need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not
        authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for
        their own marketing or other purposes.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Retention of information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
        necessary as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our
        agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is
        required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
        Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner
        that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
        Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
        the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data
        portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
        period.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">Transfer of information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and
        storing your information in a country other than your own, including
        Canada. The transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside
        the European Union will be made only if you have explicitly consented to
        it or in the cases provided for by the GDPR and will be processed in
        your interest.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers
        to a country outside the European Union or to any international
        organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
        more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by
        us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you
        can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or
        inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.

      <h2 class="text-2xl">Data protection rights under the GDPR</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have
        certain data protection rights and we aim to take reasonable steps to
        allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal
        Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we
        hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please
        contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data
        protection rights:
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously
        given your consent to the processing of your Personal Information. To
        the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal
        Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at
        any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before
        the withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information is being
        processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
        processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing
        processing.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and
        ask for it to be updated or corrected. You also have the right to
        request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is
        incomplete.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your information
        if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.
        Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the
        exercise of an official authority vested in us, or for the purposes of
        the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
        processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to
        justify the objection.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
        processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances include:
        the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we
        must verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the
        erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction of its
        use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for the
        purposes of processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or
        defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing pending the
        verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate
        grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such Personal Information
        will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, will be
        processed only with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise
        or defense of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another
        natural, or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
        erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances
        include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to
        the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you
        withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
        processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
        processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have
        been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to
        erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right
        of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal
        obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal
        claims.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you
        have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
        format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
        controller without any hindrance from us, provided that such
        transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
        others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        (viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority
        about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you are
        not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you
        have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
        authority. For more information, please contact your local data
        protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided
        that your Personal Information is processed by automated means and that
        the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are
        part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

      <h2 class="text-2xl">How to exercise your rights</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to us through the
        contact details provided in this document. Please note that we may ask
        you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Your
        request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify
        that you are the person you are claiming to be or that you are the
        authorized representative of such person. If we receive your request
        from an authorized representative, we may request evidence that you have
        provided such an authorized representative with power of attorney or
        that the authorized representative otherwise has valid written authority
        to submit requests on your behalf.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 w-2/3">
        You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand
        the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or
        provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify your
        identity or authority to make such a request and confirm that the
        Personal Information relates to you.

        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
        websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity

        over time. The Website and Services do not track its visitors over time
        and across third-party websites. However, some third-party websites may
